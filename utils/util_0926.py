    Loads a dataset that was saved with `torch.save`.
    We expect that the object that was saved is a dictionary with keys
    `train_features`, `train_labels`
    `valid_features`, `valid_labels`,
    `test_features`, `test_labels`
    storing the appropriate data in tensors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        Configuration dictionary. Required keys:  
        dataset_preprocessed_path : str
            The path where the preprocessed dataset was saved to.
        device : torch.device | int | str
            The device to map the tensors to.

    Returns
    -------
    The triple of pairs
    `(train_features, train_labels),
    (valid_feautres, valid_labels),
    (test_features, test_labels)`
